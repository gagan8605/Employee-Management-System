# Employee-Management-System
The Employee Management System is a web app for managing employee data securely. Users can log in, then add, view, edit, or delete records, each with a unique ID, name, position, and status. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the system uses JWT authentication for secure access, making it ideal for efficient and organized HR management.
